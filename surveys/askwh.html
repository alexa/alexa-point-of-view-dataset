            <p>Collecting 3 sample dialogs of you asking a virtual assistant to relay a request question, and a following virtual assistant's converted question to the recipient.</p>
        </short-summary>

        <detailed-instructions>
            <h4>First, provide WH-questions (When, What, Where, Who, Which, Why, Whose, Whom etc.) to relay to a friend, John, via virtual assistant, such as:</h4>
              <p>Ask John, what time is the meeting for next monday? (1)</p>
              <p>Ask John when the movie starts. (2)</p>
              <p>Ask John why he left home so late. (3)</p>
            <h4>Then, provide the virtual assistant's relayed message to John, from the perspective of the virtual assistant.  Assuming your name is David, the above sentences would be converted as following:</h4>
              <p>Virtual Assistant converted output of (1): David, John wants to know, what time is the meeting for next monday?</p>
              <p>Virtual Assistant converted output of (2): Hi David, John asks when the movie starts.</p>
              <p>Virtual Assistant converted output of (3): Hi David, John asks why you left the home so late.</p>
            
        </p>
        </detailed-instructions>
    </crowd-instructions>

    <p>Provide 3 dialogs of you sending a message with a WH-question (When, What, Where, Who, Which, Why, Whose, Whom etc.) to a recipient via virtual assistant, and corresponding virtual assistant's converted messages to the recipient.</p>
    
    <h3>WH-questions</h3>
    can either be direct or indirect questions that sender requests an action from the recipient.  Below are some examples for each.
    Direct Questions are still questions when standing alone; 
    in contrast, indirect questions donâ€™t make much sense/are not questions/are ungrammatical if you strip off their surrounding text.
    <ul>
        <li>direct WH-question: Ask John, whose line is it anyway? (the message itself contains questions that are directly identifiable from the sentence with no manipulation.)</p>
        <li>indirect WH-question: Ask John when he can make it back. (the utterance itself is not a question, but it contains a question.)
        <p>Format can often look like: <b>(Wh-words) + (send, sender pronoun, they) + (helper verb- can, could would should, etc.) + (message containing action or information)</b></p>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Here are some examples of how these messages are converted via virtual assistant to relay to a messenger.
    Note that there could be many variations of conversions, and here are some sample output with acceptable variations for conversion.</h3>
    <p><strong>Example 1 - Direct WH question</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Roman):  can you ask jane when do you want to get dinner? </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Variation 1): hey jane, roman is wondering when you want to get dinner.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Variation 2): hi jane, roman would like to know when you want to get dinner.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Variation 3): hi jane, roman is asking when you want to get dinner.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Variation 4): hey jane, roman wants to ask when you want to get dinner.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 2 - Indirect WH question</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Maurine): please ask nichole why she hasn't made copies for the meeting. </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant: hi nichole, maurine wants to know why you haven't made copies for the meeting.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 3 - Direct WH question</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (David): could you ask john, when can you make it this evening? </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant: Hi john, david is asking when can you make it this evening?</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 4 - Conversion with Gender Neutral Pronoun</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Alex): ask shawn why am <b>i</b> like this.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant: hi shawn, alex asks why are <b>they</b> like this.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">* Note: the pronoun <b>i</b> was converted to <b>they</b>.  Do not assume genders in conversions, and assume gender neutral "they."</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Write all your responses in the form below.</h3>
    Please spell out numbers and do not use special characters; only use lower-case alphabet [a-z] and punctuation.  Assume gender neutral pronouns in terms of converted utterances (Example 4).  Please use a few variations in your conversions.
