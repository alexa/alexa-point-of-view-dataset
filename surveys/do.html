            <p>Collecting 3 sample dialogs of you asking a virtual assistant to relay a request question, and a following virtual assistant's converted question to the recipient.</p>
        </short-summary>

        <detailed-instructions>
            <h4>First, provide do-questions or have-questions to relay to a friend, John, via virtual assistant, such as:</h4>
              <p>ask john, do you want to get coffee? (1)</p>
              <p>ask john did you get home okay yesterday? (2)</p>
              <p>ask john does Jessica have any coffee makers? (3)</p>

            <h4>Then, provide the virtual assistant's relayed message to John, from the perspective of the virtual assistant.  Assuming your name is David, the above sentences would be converted as following:</h4>
              <p>Virtual Assistant converted output of (1): hey john, david wants to know if you want to get coffee</p>
              <p>Virtual Assistant converted output of (2): greetings john, david would like to know if you got home okay</p>
              <p>Virtual Assistant converted output of (3): hi john, david is asking does jessica have any coffee makers?</p>

            
        </p>
        </detailed-instructions>
    </crowd-instructions>

    <p>Provide 6 dialogs of you sending a message with a do-question or have-question to a recipient via virtual assistant, and corresponding virtual assistant's converted messages to the recipient.</p>
    
    <h3>Questions involving "do" verbs</h3>
    do-questions involve questions with variations on do-verbs with following gramatical structures.
    <ul>
        <li>do question: [do/does/did] + [subject] + [verb] + [object] </li>
        <p>ex) ask john, <b>does jessica have a coffee machine?</b></p>

        <li>do question with negation: [don't/doesn't/didn't/do not/does not/did not] + [subject] + [verb] + [object] </li>

        <p>ex) ask john <b>who didn't you like?</b></p>

        <li>wh-object-do question: [what/where/who/whose/why/which/how] + [object] + [do/does/did] + [subject] + [verb]</li>

    <h3>Here are some examples of how these messages are converted via virtual assistant to relay to a messenger.
    Note that there could be many variations of conversions, and here are some sample output with acceptable variations for conversion.  There are direct variation in which the conversion contains stand-alone questions.  On the other hand, there are indirect variations in which implicit, re-ordered questions.</h3>
    <p><strong>Example 1 - Do question</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Roman): ask john, does jessica have a coffee machine? </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Direct variation): hi john, roman wants to know does jessica have a coffee machine?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Indirect variation): hi john, roman wants to know if jessica has a coffee machine</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 2 - Do question with negation</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Maurine): ask john didn't she have an appointment yesterday? </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Direct variation): hi john, maurine is asking didn't she have an appointment yesterday?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Indirect variation): hi john, maurine is asking if she didn't have an appointment yesterday.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 3 - WH-Do question</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Alex): ask john which did you like better?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Direct variation): hi john, alex is asking which did you like better?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Indirect variation): hi john, alex wants to know which you liked better.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 4 - WH-Do question with negation</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Nicole): ask john who didn't you like?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Direct variation): hi john, nicole is asking who didn't you like?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Indirect variation): hi john, nicole wants to know who you didn't like.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 5 - WH-object-Do question </strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Gabriel): ask john which team did she pick?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Direct variation): hi john, gabriel is asking which team did she pick?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Indirect variation): hi john, gabriel is asking which team she picked.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 6 - WH-object-Do question with negation</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Mina): ask john what kind of food doesn't she like?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Direct variation): hi john, mina is asking what kind of food doen't she like?</p>
