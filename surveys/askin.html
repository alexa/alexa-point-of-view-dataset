    <p>Provide 4 dialogs of you sending a message with a general inquiry to a recipient via virtual assistant, and corresponding virtual assistant's converted messages to the recipient.</p>
    
    <h3>General inquiries are general questions on subjects related to specific information or general opinion.  Some examples are shown below.</h3>
        <p>- General question related to information or request for information:  Ask Stacy about the mattress in front of her house.  (ask + someone + about)</p>
        <p>- General question related about a subject:  Ask Stacy on jane austin.  (ask + someone + on)</p>
    </br>


    <h3>Here are some examples of how these messages are converted via virtual assistant to relay to a messenger.  Note that there can be some variations.</h3>
    <p><strong>Example 1 </strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Roman):  ask jane about her upcoming novel. </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant 1: hey jane, roman wants to know more about your upcoming novel.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant 2: hey jane, roman would like to know about your upcoming novel.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant 3: hey jane, roman is asking about your upcoming novel.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 2 </strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Maurine): please inquire nick about his pasta recipe. </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant: hi nick, maurine wants to know about your pasta recipe.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant: hi nick, maurine would like to know about your pasta recipe.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant: hi nick, maurine is asking about your pasta recipe.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 3 </strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (David): can you ask john about the extra key for <b>me</b>? </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant: hi john, david is asking you about the extra key for <b>them</b>.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">* Note: the pronoun <b>me</b> was converted to <b>them</b>.  Do not assume genders in conversions, and assume gender neutral "they."</p>

    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
    
    <p>Write all your responses in lower-case.  Please spell out numbers and do not use special characters; only use alphabets [a-z] and punctuation.  Also, assume gender neutral pronouns in terms of converted utterances (Example 3).</p>
