            <p>Collecting 3 sample dialogs of you asking a virtual assistant to relay a yes or no question, and a following virtual assistant's converted question to the recipient.</p>
        </short-summary>

        <detailed-instructions>
            <h4>First, provide yes or no questions to relay to a friend, John, via virtual assistant, such as:</h4>
              <p>Ask John, would you like to go to the movies later today? (1)</p>
              <p>Ask John if he has any time later in the afternoon. (2)</p>
              <p>Ask John if he can make it to next week's party. (3)</p>
            <h4>Then, provide the virtual assistant's relayed message to John, from the perspective of the virtual assistant.  Assuming your name is David, the above sentences would be converted as following:</h4>
              <p>Virtual Assistant converted output of (1): Hi David, John asks, would you like to go to the movies today?</p>
              <p>Virtual Assistant converted output of (2): David, John would like to know if you have any time later in the afternoon.</p>
              <p>Virtual Assistant converted output of (3): Hi David, John asks if you can make it to next week's party?</p>
            
        
        </detailed-instructions>
    </crowd-instructions>

    <p>Provide 3 dialogs of you sending a message with a yes or no question to a recipient via virtual assistant, and corresponding virtual assistant's converted messages to the recipient.</p>
    
    <h3>Yes or No questions </h3>
    are either direct or indirect questions that can be answered with simple yes or no.  Below are some examples for each.  Direct Questions are still questions when standing alone; 
    in contrast, indirect questions donâ€™t make much sense/are not questions/are ungrammatical if you strip off their surrounding text.
    <ul>
        <li> Direct Y/N question: Ask John, would you like to go to the movies later today? (the message itself contains questions that are directly identifiable from the sentence with no manipulation.)</li>
        <li> Indirect Y/N question: Ask John if he can make it to next week's party. (the utterance itself is not a question, but it contains a question.)  
        <p>Often in the form of "ask (someone) if (inquiry)"</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Here are some examples of how these messages are converted via virtual assistant to relay to a messenger.  
    Note that there could be many variations of conversions, and here are some sample output with acceptable variations for conversion.</h3>
    <p><strong>Example 1 - Direct Question</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Roman):  can you tell jane, did you do your homework for tomorrow? </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (variation 1): hey jane, roman is wondering if you did your homework for tomorrow?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (variation 2): hi jane, roman wants to know if you did your homework for tomorrow?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (variation 3): hey jane, roman would like to know if you did your homework for tomorrow?</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (variation 4): hi jane, roman is asking if you did your homework for tomorrow?</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 2 - Indirect Question</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Maurine): please ask pizza hut if they take credit. </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Variation 1): hey pizza hut, maurine is wondering if you take credit.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Variation 2): hi pizza hut, maurine wants to know if you take credit.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Variation 3): hi pizza hut, maurine would like to know if you take credit.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Variation 4): hi pizza hut, maurine is asking if you take credit.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 3 - Direct Question</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (David): could you ask john, do you have a moment to go over last week's assignment? </p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (variation 1): hi john, david is wondering if you have a moment to go over last week's assignment.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (variation 2): hey john, david wants to know if you have a moment to go over last week's assignment.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (variation 3): hey john, david would like to know if you have a moment to go over last week's assignment.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant (Variation 4): hi john, david is asking if you have a moment to go over last week's assignment.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Example 4 - Conversion with Gender Neutral Pronoun</strong></p>
    <p>You/Sender (Alex): ask shawn if he wants to come get <b>my</b> keys.</p>
    <p>Virtual Assistant: hi shawn, alex asks if you want to come get <b>their</b> keys.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">* Note: the pronoun <b>my</b> was converted to <b>their</b>.  Do not assume genders in conversions, and assume gender neutral "they."</p>
    <br />
    <br />
